## **Covid - 19**

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The new virus was subsequently named the “COVID-19 virus”. 
On 31 December 2019, WHO was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China. A novel corona virus was identified as the cause by Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020 and was temporarily named “2019-nCoV”.
On 11 March 2020, the rapid increase in the number of cases outside China led the WHO Director-General to announce that the outbreak could be characterized as a pandemic. By then more than 118 000 cases had been reported in 114 countries, and 4291 deaths had been recorded.
In order to that the virus has being spreading over the whole world until now(2021 september),We cannot strictly predict when covid-19 will end.

### **1. Visualization of the location**         

 Algeria, is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is the largest country by total area in Africa, and by extension, the Arab world, and is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia; to the east by Libya; to the southeast by Niger; to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by Morocco; and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. The country has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the fertile north and the Sahara dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), making it the world's tenth largest nation by area. With a population of 44 million, and is the ninth-most populous country in Africa. The capital and largest city is Algiers, located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.

Pre-1962 Algeria has seen many empires and dynasties, including ancient Numidians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Rustamid, Idrisid, Aghlabids, Fatimids, Zirid, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads, Zayyanids, Spaniards, Ottomans and finally, the French Colonial Empire. The vast majority of Algeria's population is Arab-Berber, practicing Islam, and using the official languages of Arabic and Berber. However, French serves as an administrative and education language in some contexts, and Algerian Arabic is the main spoken language.

Algeria is a semi-presidential republic, with local constituencies consisting of 58 provinces and 1,541 communes. Algeria is a regional power in North Africa, and a middle power in global affairs. It has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the world's sixteenth-largest oil reserves and the ninth-largest reserves of natural gas. Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe. Algeria's military is one of the largest in Africa, and has the largest defence budget on the continent. It is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member.

### **2. Climate and weather condition**
Algeria is one of the largest countries on the African continent and has to deal with fairly large differences in climate. Algeria is is known for its Sahara desert, oases and the Atlas Mountains. The country consists for around 85% of desert. It has a long coastline and the coastal areas have a mild Mediterranean climate with hot summers and cool and rainy winters. In the highlands summers are hot and dry. Winter rains (less heavy then the coast) in the highlands begin in October. In the months January, February and March there are many sandstorms. 
Northern Algeria lies within the temperate zone, and its climate is similar to that of other Mediterranean countries, although the diversity of the relief provides sharp contrasts in temperature. The coastal region has a pleasant climate, with winter temperatures averaging from 10° to 12° C (50° to 54° F ) and average summer temperatures ranging from 24° to 26° C (75° to 79° F ). Rainfall in this region is abundant—38 to 69 cm (15 to 27 in) per year, and up to 100 cm (40 in) in the eastern part—except in the area around Oran (Ouahran), where mountains form a barrier against rain-carrying winds. When heavy rains fall (often more than 3.8 cm/1.5 in within 24 hours), they flood large areas and then evaporate so quickly that they are of little help in cultivation.

Farther inland, the climate changes; winters average 4° to 6° C (39° to 43° F ), with considerable frost and occasional snow on the massifs; summers average 26° to 28° C (79° to 82° F ). In this region, prevailing winds are westerly and northerly in winter and easterly and northeasterly in summer, resulting in a general increase in precipitation from September to December and a decrease from January to August; there is little or no rainfall in the summer months.

In the Sahara Desert, temperatures range from –10° to 34° C (14° to 93° F ), with extreme highs of 49° C (120° F ). There are daily variations of more than 44° C (80° F ). Winds are frequent and violent. Rainfall is irregular and unevenly distributed.

The rains are quite abundant. They vary according to the areas between 1.000 mm in the eastern areas (Grande Kabylia, Piccola Kabylia and Djebel Edough) and 400 mm in the western areas (Piana di Chelif, Aurès and Amour mountains).
In the spring months, particularly in April, a warm wind sometimes blows from the desert, the sirocco that transports large quantities of sand from the desert, causing intense sand storms and a sharp rise in temperature.
Algers is the capital and the largest city in algeria.Let's check there whether,Because the algeria whether is not same fr everywhere in algeria,hence it's too big country.
